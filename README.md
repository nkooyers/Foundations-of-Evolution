# Foundations-of-Evolution

This github repository provides a syllabus and course materials for a 1-credit graduate level seminar course titled 'Foundations of Evolution'. While I would love to upload all the papers from this course into this directory, I am a bit worried that this would violate some copyright agreement. However, I am more than willing to share these papers with colleagues. Please directly email me at nkooyers@gmail.com if you would like access to a google drive folder with the .pdfs.
